REFACTORING:
 (1)
	new-success-level/newSuccessLevel
	luck-amount/luckAmount are redundant. Needs to eliminate one.

 (2)
	Crosscheck that token sometimes don't have a scene = game.actors.token['id']
	Duplicate methods in helper.js and chat.js:
	- CoC7Chat._getChatCardActor
	- CoC7Chat._getActorFromKey
	- CoC7Chat.getToken
	- CoC7Chat.getActorFromToken
	- chatHelper.getActorFromKey
	- chatHelper.getTokenFromKey

	Other to check : 
	- check.js
		set actor(x)
	- actor.js
		get tokenKey()
		get actorKey()
		CoC7Actor.getActorFromKey
	- item.js
		CoC7Item._getChatCardActor
