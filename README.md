# My Call of Cthulhu implementation for Foundry VTT

My implementation of the call of Cthulhu for foundry-vtt  

## Disclaimer

This system doesn’t include any materials from the books and you’ll have to enter manually, weapons, skills, items etc… to be able to play.
I’ve just provided some basics skills that you can use.

I’m testing my dev on Chrome. Not sure how or if it will behave on other browser.

## Installation/usage

Install in foundry VTT from the Game Systems tab using the following manifest :  
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HavlockV/CoC7-FoundryVTT/master/system.json>  

Compendium 'Examples' contains a 1920's character sheet, you just need to import it to start a character. Contains also a NPC and a creature example.  
Compendium 'Skills' contains a set of basic skills that you can use for your PC/NPC.  
Compendium 'Weapons' contains a single test weapon.
Compendium 'Roll Requests' contains numerous links for all your needs.

## What is working

version 0.4.8 :

* Bug correction :
  * Kckaiwei helped to tackle some issues :
    * (#323: Pulp talents don't show when added to npc sheet unless another item type is added.)
    * (#222: [Bug] Inventory panel continuously collapsing in creature/NPC templates.)
  * Accent are now sorted correctly (é = e when it comes to sorting).
  * Weapon without skill associated are shown in red.
  * Compatibility issue with The Furnace.
* Sanity system reworked.
  * Card is divided into two main part, The top one for the player, the bottom one for the keeper.
  * System keep track of encountered creatures.
  * If a token creature have a customized san loss (different from orignal actor) it's considered like a different creature from the same specie. e.g. A Byakhee will be a 1/1D6 SAN. A baby will be 1/1D3. A monstrous may be 2/2D6. They all will be the same specie but baby and monstruous will have less/more SAN loss.
    * All creatures of that specie get credited for SAN loss.
    * When rolling the chat card will propose the keeper with option to reset that ceature/specie history.
  * The SAN flow should be fully implemented. Int roll will triggered, bout will make you immune ...
  * A bout of madness result can be rolled from a table. Table to be defined in system settings.
    * A table can contains:
      * A text (including inline deferred or not rolls [[/r 1D10]] [[ 1D10]]).
      * An other table (for phobia or mania for example).
      * An item of type status (Simple item with a description).
    * Nested calls will be resolved.
    * If the final result is a status (Phobia or mania) it will be added to that character (under Gear&Cash).
* Japanese translation updated thanks to AdmiralNyar.
* Polish translation updated thanks to Yossabart.

version 0.4.7 :

* First sheet V2 implementation.
* **Special thanks to Darshyne for providing the initial sheets design.**

version 0.4.6 :

* Bug correction :
  * Regular difficulty was misinterpreted in links.
* Polish translation added thanks to Yossabart.

Version 0.4.5 :

* Bug correction :
  * Internal field datas integrity check missing.
  * Rolling characteristics may provide non integer results.
  * Sheets not set as default are now working as intended. Thank to Sharcashmo for his help.
  * Rolling damage of weapon with DsN was showing the dice twice.
* Max SAN is automatically calculated
  * Skill 'Cthulhu Mythos' is defined in the lang.json.
  * Max SAN is calculated as 99-Cthlhu Mythos.
  * Auto calc can be bypassed in the same way as the other attributes.
* Introducing links.
* **Links TLDR.** Read next paragraph for details.
  * Links are a way for a GM to request for a roll (*Characteristic, Attribute, Skill, SAN loss, Weapon*).
  * Links are created in the chat log. When you click a link it will trigger a check for your(s) controlled/impersonated character(s).
  * Links can be included in any editor, mainly journal entries.
  * Link can be created in 5 ways:
    * By manually typing it (read details below).
    * By CTRL+click on any sheet element (Characteristic, Attribute, skill, SAN loss).
    * By dragging a sheet element (Characteristic, Attribute, skill (+CTRL)) on an editor (Journal entry)
    * By CTRL + dragging an item (skill or weapon) from a compendium or an item directory on an editor. When a link is created that way and the used as a GM, if your controlled character doen't hold the weapon/skill you'll be prompted to create the corresponding item.
    * By using the included compendium written by Lozalojo.
  * Links can be dragged from chat log on an editor.
  * When a link is created the difficulty/penalty selection windows will open. Hold SHIFT to bypass that comportment.
  * When a link is created, the roll mode will be check. If the roll mode is set to 'blind GM roll' the link will be created as blind.
  * When a link is created with a difficulty and a penalty, the difficulty/penalty windows will not pop.
  * When a link is created without a difficulty or a penalty, the difficulty/penalty windows will pop. Holding SHIFT will fastforward the roll (regular/no penalty).
* **Details** First implementation of CoC7 links for chat messages and sheet editors (NPC, Journal entries...).
  * Format of link is @coc7.TYPE_OF_REQUEST[OPTIONS]{TEXT_TO_DISPLAY}
    * TYPE_OF_REQUEST :
      * 'sanloss': trigger a san check, upon failure will propose to deduct the corresponding SAN.
      * 'check': trigger a check depending on the options.
      * 'item': trigger use of a weapon. Only items of type weapon can be triggered.
    * OPTIONS: [] = optional, __*default*__
      * sanloss:
        * sanMax: max SAN loss
        * sanMin: min SAN loss
      * check:
        * type: type of check (characteristic, skill, attrib).
        * name: name of the skill/characteristic/attrib.
        * [blind]: will force a blind check, if not present the check will depend on your selected roll mode.
      * all:
        * [difficulty]: ? (blind), __*0 (regular)*__, + (hard), ++ (extreme), +++ (critical).
        * [modifier]: -x (x penalty dice), +x (x bonus dice), __*0 (no modifier)*__.
        * [icon]: icon tu use (font awesome, __*fas fa-dice*__).
    * TEXT_TO_DISPLAY: Name to display, this is optional.
  * Some examples :
    * `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1D6,sanMin:1,difficulty:++,modifier:-1]{Hard San Loss (-1) 1/1D6}`
    * `@coc7.check[type:charac,name:STR,difficulty:+,modifier:-1]{Hard STR check(-1)}`
    * `@coc7.check[type:attrib,name:lck,difficulty:+,modifier:-1]{Hard luck check(-1)}`
    * With icon : `@coc7.check[type:skill,icon:fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right,name:anthropology,difficulty:+,modifier:-1]{Hard Anthropology check(-1)}`
    * Without name, difficulty nor modifier: `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1D6,sanMin:1]`
    * With icon, without name nor difficulty `@coc7.check[type:skill,icon:fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right,name:anthropology,modifier:+1]`
  * You can drag/drop links from chat to sheets and between sheets.
  * You can drag/drop items and skills on a journal entry while holding CTRL, this will create the corresponding check with regular difficulty and 0 modifier.
  * You can create link in the chat by clicking and holding CTRL from any sheet (PC/NPC/Creature) corresponding characteristic/luck/SAN/Competence/weapon/San loss.
    * This will open the select penalty/difficulty dialogue. Clicking on the generated link will then trigger the check with all parameters.
    * Holding Shift on top will not open the penalty/difficulty dialogue. Clicking on the generated link will open the penalty/difficulty dialogue then trigger the check.
* Skill macro updated to accept and optional 3rd parameter options.
  * e.g. options = {difficulty:'++', modifier:-1, blind:true}. All those parameter are optional, default will be regular difficulty, no modifier, non blind check.

  * Holding shift while clicking the + sign will not open the sheet just create a generic entity.
* Creatures have a formula button, allowing to enter formulas instead of characteristics.
  * Formulas need to be valid roll strings (like the /r command).
* Starting to implement localization.  

version 0.1.6 (07/06):

* Lock mechanism to avoid inadvertent actor modification (NPC only so far).  
* Implementation of basic NPC sheet.
* Using basic NPC sheet for creature.
* Bug correction:
  * You can add many time the same weapon or item, not twice the same skill with the same name.

Version 0.1.5 (01/06) :  

* Luck and San roll implemented.  
* Start implementing NPC sheet with only attributes and skills.  
* Mention of eras in skills removed. It is much simpler to just create a character sheet template and a compendium for each setting.
* Attributes (HP, MP, San, Luck) values can bet set using the mouse-wheel.
* Bug correction:
  * Parasite (future) windows during skill roll removed.  

Version 0.1.4 (31/05) :

* You can spend luck (providing you have enough) to pass a failed check.  
* You can push a skill if it is 'pushable' (pushed enabled on the skill sheet).  
* Typo correction.  

Version 0.1.3 :  

* The character sheet.  
  * You can enter your characteristics. Entering them will update the attributes (max HP, MP …).  
  * If a field is not editable it’s because it’s locked (black border). Double clicking on it will unlock it (red border, this is to prevent inadvertent modifications).  
  * Manually modifying an automatic field  (like max HP) will remove the auto calculation. To reset it, set it to -1.  
* You can roll skills from the sheet by clicking the icon.  
* You can roll your weapons from the combat tab. If the weapon is tagged as ‘Full-Auto’ you will see 2 clickable zones reflecting the 2 different skills used in normal and auto mode.  
  * If the background is red, that’s because no skill have been attached to that weapon, edit the weapon to assign a skill to roll.  
* You can roll a characteristics by clicking his name
* Clicking the icon/name will perform and advanced roll (dialogue selection for penalty/bonus and difficulty).  
* Holding shift while clicking will roll the dice with no penalty vs regular difficulty.
