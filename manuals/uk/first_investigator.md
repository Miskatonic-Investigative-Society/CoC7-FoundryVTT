# Initial item setup

The system comes with some compendiums ready for you to customise. These are reset every time you update or install the system so it is recommended you copy them into your own compendium and edit them as required.

This page creates an investigator using the provided compendiums, if you are ready to full customise your character people read [Character creation](character_creation.md) instead.

# Skill

Click on the Compendium Packs tab then under the Item heading open up the Skills Item (CoC7). Here you will find the skills shown on the characters sheets available from Chaosium's website.

- _No adjustment_ - Can not be assigned personal skill points.
- _No XP gain_ - You do not mark this skill for improvement on a success.
- _Specialization_ - This skill is part of a group like Pilot or Flighting.
- _Uncommon_ - This skill is uncommon and can be automatically hidden on the character sheet.
