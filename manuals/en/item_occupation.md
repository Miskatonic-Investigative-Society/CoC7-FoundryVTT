# Item Type: Occupation

An _occupation_ helps to define the character background, think about it as the definition of the set of _occupational skills_ (the ones where the character can spend their occupation points) plus the definition of how to calculate the amount of available occupation points. Finally the _occupation_ also allows to define the minimum and the maximum _credit_ for a character with this _occupation_.

Keep in mind that the set of _occupational skills_ doesn't need to be fixed, the system allows to configure the _occupation_ so when it's dragged to a Character sheet will give the option of selecting one or more skills from a closed list, or even add a pre defined number of skills to select from all the available ones.
