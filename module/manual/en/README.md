# System documentation for version 7.0

This document is a work in progress overview of the CoC7 system it is not a tutorial for how to use FoundryVTT.

You will need one of the following to play the game

- Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition - Keeper's Rulebook
- Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition - Call of Cthulhu Starter Set
- Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition - Quick-Start Rules

The system automates most of the regular tasks and rules involved with running a game.

Several parts of the actor sheets have pop up tooltips that trigger after two seconds, this delay can be changed in the settings

This documentation can be reopened under [fas fa-cogs]Game Settings -> Help and Documentation -> View CoC7 System Manual

To access this menu you will need to have an active scene which can be created in the [fas fa-map]Scenes Directory. These options are only available to the Keeper.

- _Keeper's tools_
  - _Development phase_: When enabled, players can make improvement rolls for their marked skills.
  - _Character creation mode_: When enabled, players can distribute points among their skills.
  - _XP gain_: When enabled, a skill will be marked for improvement after a successful check.
  - _Send a decoy roll to players_: When clicked, players will see a fake GM private roll.
  - _Start Rest_: When click, pick characters to perform a rest and roll for XP gains.

# Keyboard and mouse shortcuts

There are many elements in the sheets that trigger a dice roll when clicked. Usually a dialog is shown to prompt the user for a difficulty and a possible bonus or penalty. This behavior is modified with the following controls:

- Right click on any rollable element to include it in an opposed roll. As long as the card is open, all rolls made
  with a right click will be added to the opposed roll.
- Alt + Right click on any rollable element to include it in a combined roll.
- Shift + Left click on a rollable element will make a roll without asking for difficulty or bonus/penalty.
- Ctrl + Left click on a rollable element will create a roll request. Only available for the GM.
- Alt + Left click on sanity will prompt the player for minimum and maximum sanity loss.
