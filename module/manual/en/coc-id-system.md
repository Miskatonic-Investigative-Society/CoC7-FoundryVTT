# CoC ID System

Several FoundryVTT documents have an ID button accessable to "Game Master" and "Assistant GM" User Roles.

**System ID (CoC ID)**: Setting a skill's ID to i.skill.dodge will let the system know to treat that skill as Dodge on the combat card.

**Language**: Which languge is this version of the Item in.

**Cthulhu Flavors**: You can also control the era a skill is for, Animal Handling has different base values based on the era

**System ID Priority**: The highest number will be considered best

## Item
i.setup.example - The Investigator Wizard will use these you need to pick a single era to assign it to

i.archetype.example - The Investigator Wizard will use these if the archetype optional rule is enabled

i.occupation.example - The Investigator Wizard will list these

i.skill.example - Setups, Investigator Wizard, and creating Actors will use these if the era matches

## RollTable
rt..backstory-example - If the example part matches the backstory title in kebab case it will give a roll option in the backstory section of the Investigator Wizard

## Translations
You can use the Keeper's tools on the left hand menu to update Actors based on CoC ID Items you have in your world, you need a scene to be able to access this menu

## RQID
This system is based on RQID from the "[Runequest Glorantha](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/rqg)" system, documentation for it can be found here [https://sun-dragon-cult.github.io/rqg-system/api/rqid](https://sun-dragon-cult.github.io/rqg-system/api/rqid)
