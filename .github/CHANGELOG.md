- **Links TLDR.** Read next paragraph for details.
  - Links are a way for a GM to request for a roll (_Characteristic, Attribute, Skill, SAN loss, Weapon_).
  - Links are created in the chat log. When you click a link it will trigger a check for your(s) controlled/impersonated character(s).
  - Links can be included in any editor, mainly journal entries.
  - Link can be created in 5 ways:
    - By manually typing it (read details below).
    - By CTRL+click on any sheet element (Characteristic, Attribute, skill, SAN loss).
    - By dragging a sheet element (Characteristic, Attribute, skill (+CTRL)) on an editor (Journal entry)
    - By CTRL + dragging an item (skill or weapon) from a compendium or an item directory on an editor. When a link is created that way and the used as a GM, if your controlled character doesn't hold the weapon/skill you'll be prompted to create the corresponding item.
    - By using the included compendium written by Lozalojo.
  - Links can be dragged from chat log on an editor.
  - When a link is created the difficulty/penalty selection windows will open. Hold SHIFT to bypass that comportment.
  - When a link is created, the roll mode will be check. If the roll mode is set to 'blind GM roll' the link will be created as blind.
  - When a link is created with a difficulty and a penalty, the difficulty/penalty windows will not pop.
  - When a link is created without a difficulty or a penalty, the difficulty/penalty windows will pop. Holding SHIFT will fast-forward the roll (regular/no penalty).
- **Details** First implementation of CoC7 links for chat messages and sheet editors (NPC, Journal entries...).
  - Format of link is @coc7.TYPE_OF_REQUEST[OPTIONS]{TEXT_TO_DISPLAY}
    - TYPE_OF_REQUEST :
      - 'sanloss': trigger a san check, upon failure will propose to deduct the corresponding SAN.
      - 'check': trigger a check depending on the options.
      - 'item': trigger use of a weapon. Only items of type weapon can be triggered.
    - OPTIONS: [] = optional, **_default_**
      - sanloss:
        - sanMax: max SAN loss
        - sanMin: min SAN loss
      - check:
        - type: type of check (characteristic, skill, attrib).
        - name: name of the skill/characteristic/attrib.
        - [blind]: will force a blind check, if not present the check will depend on your selected roll mode.
      - all:
        - [difficulty]: ? (blind), **_0 (regular)_**, + (hard), ++ (extreme), +++ (critical).
        - [modifier]: -x (x penalty dice), +x (x bonus dice), **_0 (no modifier)_**.
        - [icon]: icon tu use (font awesome, **_fas fa-dice_**).
    - TEXT_TO_DISPLAY: Name to display, this is optional.
  - Some examples :
    - `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1D6,sanMin:1,difficulty:++,modifier:-1]{Hard San Loss (-1) 1/1D6}`
    - `@coc7.check[type:charac,name:STR,difficulty:+,modifier:-1]{Hard STR check(-1)}`
    - `@coc7.check[type:attrib,name:lck,difficulty:+,modifier:-1]{Hard luck check(-1)}`
    - With icon : `@coc7.check[type:skill,icon:fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right,name:anthropology,difficulty:+,modifier:-1]{Hard Anthropology check(-1)}`
    - Without name, difficulty nor modifier: `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1D6,sanMin:1]`
    - With icon, without name nor difficulty `@coc7.check[type:skill,icon:fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right,name:anthropology,modifier:+1]`
  - You can drag/drop links from chat to sheets and between sheets.
  - You can drag/drop items and skills on a journal entry while holding CTRL, this will create the corresponding check with regular difficulty and 0 modifier.
  - You can create link in the chat by clicking and holding CTRL from any sheet (PC/NPC/Creature) corresponding characteristic/luck/SAN/Competence/weapon/San loss.
    - This will open the select penalty/difficulty dialogue. Clicking on the generated link will then trigger the check with all parameters.
    - Holding Shift on top will not open the penalty/difficulty dialogue. Clicking on the generated link will open the penalty/difficulty dialogue then trigger the check.

  - You can now see the distance from the target below the target selector in the chat-card and on the tool-tip of the target.
