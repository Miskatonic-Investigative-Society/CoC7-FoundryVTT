Sanity Checks
-------------

The system has integrated the sanity check workflow and can handle sanity rolls, tracking _Sanity_ loss and rolling for temporal insanity.

## Requesting Sanity rolls

* The Guardian can click with `Ctrl+Shift` on the _Sanity_ of character to request a Sanity Check for the character
    * If the Guardian also press `Alt` (so holding at the same time `Ctrl+Shift+Alt`) while clicking on the _Sanity_ of a character, a dialog will pop-up to introduce the sanity loss if the sanity check is passed and the value for when the sanity check is failed.
