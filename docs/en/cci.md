# Chaosium Canvas Interface

FoundryVTT v12 implemented Scene Regions which allows you to trigger Behaviors based on token interactions.

The FoundryVTT Knowledge Base has information on using [Drawings](https://foundryvtt.com/article/drawings/), [Map Notes](https://foundryvtt.com/article/map-notes/), [Scene Regions](https://foundryvtt.com/article/scene-regions/), and [Tiles](https://foundryvtt.com/article/tiles/) it is recommend you have a basic understanding of each before continuing.

## Additional Scene Region Behaviors
Clickable Events extends this to allow mouse interactions to run macros, Chaosium Canvas Interface is a simplified version that makes it easier to add to your own scenes.

You can get the UUID for Drawing, Map Notes, Scene Regions, and Tiles by clicking the Copy Document UUID button in the header.

If you are using FoundryVTT v13 you can drag Scene Regions and Region Behaviors onto the Behaviors tab to duplicate them into your new Scene Region
