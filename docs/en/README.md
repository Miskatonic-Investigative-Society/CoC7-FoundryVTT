# System documentation for version 7.21

This document is a work in progress overview of the CoC7 system it is not a tutorial for how to use FoundryVTT.

You will need one of the following to play the game

- Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition - Keeper's Rulebook
- Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition - Call of Cthulhu Starter Set
- Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition - Quick-Start Rules

The system automates most of the regular tasks and rules involved with running a game.

Several parts of the actor sheets have pop up tooltips that trigger after two seconds, this delay can be changed in the settings

This documentation can be reopened under Game Settings -> Help and Documentation -> View CoC7 System Manual

- _Keeper's tools_
  - _Development phase_: When enabled, players can make improvement rolls for their marked skills.
  - _Character creation mode_: When enabled, players can distribute points among their skills.

# Keyboard and mouse shortcuts

There are many elements in the sheets that trigger a dice roll when clicked. Usually a dialog is shown to prompt the user for a difficulty and a possible bonus or penalty. This behavior is modified with the following controls:

- Right click on any rollable element to include it in an opposed roll. As long as the card is open, all rolls made
  with a right click will be added to the opposed roll.
- Alt + Right click on any rollable element to include it in a combined roll.
- Shift + Left click on a rollable element will make a roll without asking for difficulty or bonus/penalty.
- Ctrl + Left click on a rollable element will create a roll request. Only available for the GM.
- Alt + Left click on sanity will prompt the player for minimum and maximum sanity loss.
